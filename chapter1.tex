\section{Wikipedia}
\label{sec:wiki}
Wikipedia is a free-access, free-content Internet encyclopedia, supported and hosted by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation.
Contributors can access the site can edit most of its articles.
Wikipedia is ranked among the ten most popular websites, and constitutes the Internet's largest and most popular general reference work.
%TODO: CITEME: Bill Tancer (May 1, 2007). "Look Who's Using Wikipedia". Time. Retrieved December 1, 2007. The sheer volume of content [...] is partly responsible for the site's dominance as an online reference. When compared to the top 3,200 educational reference sites in the US, Wikipedia is No. 1, capturing 24.3% of all visits to the category. Cf. Bill Tancer (Global Manager, Hitwise), "Wikipedia, Search and School Homework", Hitwise, March 1, 2007.

\subsection{Structure}
\label{ssec:wiki_structure}
In this section we describe the various entities that compose Wikipedia which are relevant to our analysis.

The basic block of Wikipedia is the \emph{page}.
Pages are plain text document that can be customized using the wiki markup language, which is rendered when a user requests it.
A Wikipedia \emph{article}, or entry, is a page that has encyclopedic information on it.
A well-written encyclopedia article identifies a notable encyclopedic topic, summarizes that topic comprehensively, contains references to reliable sources, and links to other related topics.

A Wikipedia \emph{namespace} is a set of Wikipedia pages whose names begin with a particular reserved word recognized by the MediaWiki software (followed by a colon).
For example, in the user namespace all titles begin with ``User:''.
In the case of the article (or main) namespace, in which encyclopedia articles appear, the reserved word and colon are absent.

At the time of writing, Wikipedia has 35 current namespaces: 16 subject namespaces, 16 corresponding talk namespaces, 2 virtual namespaces, and 1 special namespace.

Pages under the virtual namespaces (``Special'' and ``Media'') are not actually stored in the wikipedia database.
Special pages are created on demand by the MediaWiki software: for instance, ``Special:Log'' lists the log of all the activities on Wikipedia.
Files like images, videos and other assets live under the ``Media'' namespace.

Every time a contributor edits a page, a new \emph{revision} is created.
It contains the text of the new version, as well as information about the contributor, the timestamp, the comment and others.

\section{Microsoft Academic Service}
\label{sec:mag}
Microsoft Academic Search is an experimental research service developed by Microsoft Research to explore how scholars, scientists, students, and practitioners find academic content, researchers, institutions, and activities.
According to the authors, the service has already indexed 83 million papers achieving an above-95\% accuracy~\cite{Sinha2015}.
The service can also display the key relationships between and among subjects, content, and authors, highlighting the critical links that help define scientific research.

For these reasons, we use this service in our analysis.
The dataset is available under the name of ``Microsoft Academic Graph''.

The available entities relevant to our research are the following:
\begin{description*}
    \item[Papers] Contains information like the name of the paper, the publication date, its \ac{DOI} (if available), the journal or the conference where it appeared on.
    \item[PaperReferences] Contains the references between papers.
    \item[Journals] Contains the list of journals.
    \item[Conference] Contains the list of conferences.
\end{description*}
