My gratitude goes to my parents and my grandparents,

which always support all my choices and always believe in me.

I want to thank my mum, which is always present and ready to console me whenever I need.

A heartfelt thanks goes to all of my friends that could bear me up to this point,

especially to Davide which shared with me the long journey that started ten years ago.
